# CS350- Emerging Systems Architecture and Technologies

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I chose two of my assignments to highlight from this course:

# Milestone 3 : Input with Button Lab
The purpose of this lab is to create a state machiene that can make the red and blue LEDs blink in a pattern that communicates Morse code messages to anyone viewing the LEDs. 
When the button is pressed, the terminal and device will process the button input and produce a message that either says "OK" or "SOS and flash the Morse Code that correspomds with the LED light. When the button is pressed the current message that is being diplayed will not be interrupted 

# What did you do particularly well?
I think for this assignemt, I did a great job implementing the code that was needed to control the LEDs. I believe I created a smooth transition between states, ensuring that the LEDs followed the correct blinking patterns and that the button presses correctly triggered message changes without disrupting the current message

# Where could you improve?
I think i can improve my program by testing my device with additional messages and timing patterns to make sure it can handle the code as it gets more complex.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I think from the project, the intial set up for button respones and input is something I can tranfer for future coursework.

# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure that my code was maintainable, readable, and adaptable by consistently testing and monitoring the actions and outputs.

# Final Project: Thermostat Lab :
The purpose of this lab is to create a theromostat prototype that can sense and dispaly the date and time, current temperature, and the setpoint temperature on the LCD. If the heat is on, the red LED will light up and if it's set to cool then the blue LED will light up. 

 # What did you do particularly well?
 I think for this project, I think my program behaves as an expected thermostat. 
 
# Where could you improve?
I think i can improve with my wiring or displaying messages on the LCD. Even though my program is correct, my LCD kept glitching and showed diffent symbols. The correct message does pop up, but it is not consistent like I would like it to be. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I think from this project being able to actually program and  operate an actual prototype can be useful for future personal projects and to show future employers.


# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure that my code was maintainable, readable, and adaptable by consistently testing and monitoring the actions and outputs.

# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Some tools that I am adding for support are the lab guides and raspberry pi resources so that I can keep practing with building emb systems .
